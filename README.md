# Parallel-Programing-DNA_Sequence

# A genome is a complete collection of DNA in an organism. All living species possess a genome, but they differ considerably in size. The human genome, for instance, is arranged into 23 chromosomes, which is a little bit like an encyclopedia being organized into 23 volumes. And if you counted all the characters (individual DNA “base pairs”), there would be more than 6 billion in each human genome. So it’s a huge compilation.

#A human genome has about 6 billion characters or letters. If you think the genome(the complete DNA sequence) is like a book, it is a book about 6 billion letters of “A”, “C”, “G” and “T”. Now, everyone has a unique genome. Nevertheless, scientists find most parts of the human genomes are alike to each other.

#Aim of Project:
1- Count Appearance of each Character “A”, “C”, “G” and “T” in given TestCases and Calculate the Time taken by four designs of Code ( Sequential, OpenMp, MPI, Hybird Code between MPI & OpenMP)
2- Count “GCCAGATATTCCCCCCGTT” appearance in given TestCases and Calculate the Time taken by four designs of Code ( Sequential, OpenMp, MPI, Hybird Code between MPI & OpenMP)
